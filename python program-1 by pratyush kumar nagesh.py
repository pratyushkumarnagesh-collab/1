'''#If I write a code like 
int("3.2")
it would give a value error as int function cannot convert more than one type of data type'''
'''###I learned to use float(), str(), bool() today!!!'''
'''a=float(60.7)
print (a)
^here yout are limited to using numbers 
but in str conversion you are free to use what ever you want but the statements should be inside the quoation mark
b=str("hello boiii!!!^-^")
print (b)
a=bool (45)
print (a)
^Here the value which we get is always in True or False, it depends on what the value inside the bracket is, it can be anything but null or zero, basically whatever which represent zero
like "",'',0,0.0,() to give the output as true.And as for False we can use the exception values'''
'''I also learned about using multiple functions like'''
"""
a=float(int(0.46577))
print (a)
b=str(float(679))
print(b)
c=bool(str(""))
print (c)"""

#HOW???????? DOES IT WORK??
'''
a = int(input("enter a number "))
print ("even"if a % 2 == 0 else "odd")
